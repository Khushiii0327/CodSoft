Welcome to my Data Science Internship Showcase!!!
In this repository, you'll discover a compilation of projects completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project highlights my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:
**PROJECTS**
1. Titanic Survival Prediction: This project revolves around examining the Titanic dataset to forecast passenger survival. It encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and constructing a machine learning model to estimate survival probabilities.
2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python: Within this project, I crafted a system for predicting movie ratings using Python. The workflow involves gathering data, preprocessing, and creating a machine learning model for predicting movie ratings.
3. Sales Prediction Using Python: Concentrating on sales prediction for a business, this project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the creation of a predictive model to anticipate future sales.
4. Credit Card Fraud Detection : The Credit Card Fraud Detection project involved formulating a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The project addresses class imbalance, performs data preprocessing, and employs logistic regression for classification.
